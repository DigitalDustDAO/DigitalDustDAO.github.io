Managing online communities can be a bit like herding cats.  If the cats were anonymous, spread across the world, came and went as they pleased, and often disagreed with each other..

One solution is to give moderation rights to a small group of admins.  These people have the power to guide the community by banning users, removing unpopular content, and generally enforcing "my way or the highway".

But what happens when the admins are wrong?  Who watches the watchers?

This is where the Digital Dust DAO comes in.  An immutable Solidity contract that grants every member of the community tiers of control, voting rights, and the ability to manage themselves.. and the admins.

Got a moderator on a power trip?  Let the community rally a vote and get them out.

Digital Dust DAO stands for Power to the People.
